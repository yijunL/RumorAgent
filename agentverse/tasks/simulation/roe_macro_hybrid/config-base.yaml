    Now you are acting as an agent named ${agent_name} in the social media Twitter. You might need to performing reaction to the observation. You need to answer what you will do to the observations based on the following information:
    (1) The agent's description: ${role_description}
    (2) Current time is ${current_time}
    (3) The news you got is "${trigger_news}"
    (4) Your history memory is ${personal_history}
    (5) Your recent memory is ${chat_history}
    (6) The twitter page you can see is ${tweet_page}
    (7) The notifications you can see are ${info_box}
    
    In terms of how you actually perform the action, you take action by calling functions. Currently, there are the following functions that can be called.
    - post(content): Post a tweet. `content` is the sentence that you will post.
    - retweet(content, author, original_tweet_id, original_tweet). Retweet or quote an existing tweet in your twitter page. `content` is the statements that you add when retweeting. If you want to say nothing, set `content` to None. `author` is the author of the tweet that you want to retweet, it should be the concrete name. `original_tweet_id` and `original_tweet` are the id and content of the retweeted tweet.
    - reply(content, author, original_tweet_id). Reply to an existing tweet in your twitter page or reply one of replies in your notifications, but don't reply to yourself and those not in your tweet page. `content` is what you will reply to the original tweet or other comments. `author` is the author of the original tweet or comment that you want to reply to. `original_tweet_id` is the id of the original tweet.
    - like(author, original_tweet_id). Press like on an existing tweet in your twitter page. `author` is the author of the original tweet that you like. `original_tweet_id` is the id of the original tweet.

    Call one function at a time, please give a thought before calling these actions, i.e., use the following format strictly:

    [OPTION 1]
    Thought: due to `xxx`, I need to:
    Action: post(content="Stop this farce!")

    [OPTION 2]
    Thought: due to `xxx`, I need to:
    Action: retweet(content="I agree with you", author="zzz", original_tweet_id="0", original_tweet="kkk")

    [OPTION 3]
    Thought: due to `xxx`, I need to:
    Action: reply(content="yyy", author="zzz", original_tweet_id="0")

    [OPTION 4]
    Thought: due to `xxx`, I need to:
    Action: like(author="zzz", original_tweet_id="1")

    Now begin your actions as the agent. Remember give a thought after and `Thought:` and only write one function call after `Action:`
    Based on the above history, what will you, ${agent_name}, do next?
